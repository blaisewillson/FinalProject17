My Final Project for Programming Class

Description:
It is a rpg style game inspired by the game Angband.  It is ascii character based and uses python libraries such as curses to create the game movement and selection.  The game has 7 floors that it switches to every time u walk up to a '<' symbol.  There are also shops which sell items.  The purpose of the game is to level up your character and descend the floors of the dungeon to defeat the final boss.
